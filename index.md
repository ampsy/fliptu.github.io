# Fliptu API v1

## https://fliptu.com back-end

Access token should be passed as an http parameter:

* inside the url for GET requests:
{% highlight bash %}
curl 'https://fliptu.com/api/v1/overview?access_token=...'
{% endhighlight %}
* inside the url or the post body for POST requests:
{% highlight bash %}
curl -d 'access_token=...&account_id=...' https://fliptu.com/api/v1/brands/:id/accounts/:network
{% endhighlight %}
* all calls that don't require access token still use it if it's present (to determine if user has access to the flipbook or can like the flip for example)

### Fliptu.login(client_id, callback)

Connects fliptu account to the 3rd party app using the oauth-like flow - it opens up a fliptu login dialog with the ability to signup and login using email and facebook, recover password, etc and asks users to connect fliptu account with 3rd party app and then generates a new access token for the user/app pair and triggers the callback with that token. (for example wordpress integration app calls it like this `Fliptu.login('wordpress', function (token) { ... })` - the client_id is 'wix' and 'wordpress' for now) - and the token will be null if user cancels the connect request

### Fliptu.social(network, callback)

Adds a social account to fliptu app and returns one-time unique code in the callback, it doesn't connect the account to any brand or auth a user - it should be done using the `POST /api/v1/brands/:id/accounts/:network` endpoint from above (for example `Fliptu.social('twitter', function (accountId) { ... })`)

### Fliptu.importBrands(access_token, callback)

Asks to grant manage pages permission: opens a new window with 'import brands' button which triggers facebook login - if fliptu user identified by the `acces_token` already has a facebook account and currently logged in facebook user is not that account, then alert is displayed; if user doesn't grant manage_pages permission, alert is displayed; if everything is ok then `callback` is triggered with `{ success: true }`
